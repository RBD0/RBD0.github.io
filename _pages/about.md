I am a final year dual degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) student at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) majoring in Mathematics and Computing. My research interests include cryptography, with a focus on Isogeny-based cryptography.

I am currently writing my M.Tech. thesis on "Cryptographic Primitives through Group Actions" under the supervision of [Prof. Venkata Koppula](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~kvenkata/) and [Prof. Surjeet Kour](https://sites.google.com/view/surjeetkour).

Previously, I interned at [MSO Lab](https://www.msolab.org/), where I worked on an approximation algorithm for an NP-hard scheduling problem under the guidance of [Prof. Kangbok Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/kangbokstudy/). 

Through coursework at the [Mathematics Departments of IIT Delhi](https://maths.iitd.ac.in/) and [POSTECH Mathematical Institute](https://pmi.postech.ac.kr/), I have also gained extensive training in Algebra and Number Theory.
