I am a final year dual degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) student at IIT Delhi studying Mathematics and Computing. I am primarily interested in Post-Quantum Cryptography, specifically Isogeny-Based Cryptography. 

I am working on my M.Tech. project under the guidance of [Prof. Venkata Koppula](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~kvenkata/) and [Prof. Surjeet Kour](https://sites.google.com/view/surjeetkour).
